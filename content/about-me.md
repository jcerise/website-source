I am a software engineer. I program primarily in Python and Go, and whatever other languages strike my fancy (Go, Kotlin, Scala, Rust, Erlang, Elm, Javascript, etc). I also do other things like miniature wargaming, downhill mountain biking, and video games. Sometimes I write about these things here.
